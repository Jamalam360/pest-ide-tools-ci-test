# Test Cases

These are manual tests that should be performed to ensure the server is working correctly.

- Check error reporting works as expected.
- Check autocompletion works as expected.
- Check formatting works as expected.
- Check that rules with documentation show that documentation on hover.
- Check that builtins show documentation on hover.
- Check that the unused rule diagnostic works, with and without the `pestIdeTools.alwaysUsedRuleNames` configuration.
- Check go to definition and find references works correctly.
- Check that renaming rules works as expected.
- Check the CJK characters example works. Attempt to hover over a CJK rule to see if the server crashes.
